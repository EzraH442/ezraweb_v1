        <h1>March</h1>

        <p>
            We had a trig quiz yesterday and we were supposed to do it in 2 parts: one with a calculator and one without a calculator.
            However, tons of people in my class needed extra time for the first part, so we are doing the second part on Monday.
            You really need to be able to remember the special values for trig angles or else you won't have enough time. <br />
            We also had the polynomials unit final. I feel like I did really well on it, and even solved the last question on it.
            We haven't gotten our marks back yet, but I'm sure I did really well.
        </p>

            We started the solutions unit last week, and to put it bluntly, our teacher is terrible at managing information. The 
            notes we take are very scattered and unorganized. Funnily enough, I found the entire quiz from last semester on d2l.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We also started working with arduinos in the robotics club, which is awesome. In the last two weeks, I've learned so much about
            circuits, breadboards, how to write code for an arduino, and robotics in general. I'm working on a way to be able to turn off
            my light from my bedside.
